# creditcard


This program uses phantom.js to scrape bank websites for their current credit card offers. It grabs the name, link, rewards program, intro bonus and any points/miles, cash back, statement credit, or hotel reimbursement. It also grabs the fee associated with the card and if it is waived the first year or not. 

It then scrapes thepointsguy.com for their monthly point valuations to convert points to a dollar value. 

Finally, it calculates the dollar value for each intro bonus and wether it is at a maximum or not. 

The results can then be emailed, or stored in a database to biuld a webapp on top of.
